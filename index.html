            <h2>Early life and education</h2>
            <p>
                Born on October 18, 1975, Sawyer grew up in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, and is the son of Linda Sawyer and
                sculptor Gerald P. Sawyer. Of German ancestry, he earned a BA degree from Lawrence University in
                Appleton, Wisconsin. In addition to being a history major, Sawyer participated in the theater. After
                Lawrence, Sawyer moved to California.
            </p>

            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>
                Starting as a web designer at Black Isle Studios in 1999, he quickly worked his way up the ladder to an
                associate designer position and then lead designer on Icewind Dale II.
            </p>
            <p>
                In November 2003 Sawyer announced his departure from Black Isle, where he had been serving as lead
                designer of Fallout 3, to pursue other projects. Interplay went on to close Black Isle two weeks after
                Sawyer's departure.
            </p>
            <p>
                On July 19, 2005, GameSpot reported that he had left Midway's Gauntlet: Seven Sorrows, and was accepting
                a position at Obsidian Entertainment, a studio founded and staffed by many veterans of Black Isle. His
                first role was as the lead designer for Neverwinter Nights 2.
            </p>
            <p id="new-vegas">
                He later acted as the project director and lead designer of Fallout: New Vegas.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2012, with Obsidian on the brink of financial disaster after the cancellation of another project by a
                publisher, Sawyer proposed the company return to its design roots by making an isometric RPG in the
                style of those created at Black Isle. Arguing there was a market for this type of game among fans,
                Sawyer suggested turning to the platform Kickstarter to secure funding for development without a
                publisher. He succeeded in persuading company leadership, and the game, Pillars of Eternity, met its
                Kickstarter funding goal of 1.1 million dollars in 27 hours. It ultimately raised nearly four million
                dollars, setting a Kickstarter record at the time. Sawyer later served as the director and narrative
                designer on its sequel, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, which was also crowdfunded and released in
                2018.
